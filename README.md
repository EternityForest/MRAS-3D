3D-Printed modular quick-release rail system

Designed to be printable in most orientations, without any special tuning.

It is meant for building modular storage and electronics, mounting devices to walls, and any other time where you'd like to use a DIN rail, but need something smaller for something non-critical.

A piece of filament bent into a U shape is used as a pin to connect the two pieces. Inserting the pin is rather easy, and once attached, they are nearly impossible to separate be any means besides pulling the pin.

Mechanical drawings are included, as is the full FreeCad Assembly3 document.

The system is based on 32mm tiles, with 2 pin holes 16mm apart. Tiles can be repeated to form a rail of any length. A 4.6mm hole in the middle of every male tile allows use as a wall mounted rail.

The gap between parts is meant to be covered by 1/4x1/8 foam tape, providing both extra pressure to hold the pin in place, and vibration isolation. It also keeps the flat area, which would need support to print upside-down, away from direct contact, as the burrs left by support interfere with fit unless you carefully sand.

The full finished products should normally be a multiple of 32, minus a gap on all sides for clearence. The peg holes should be 16mm from the ideal 32mm edge, not the real edge that allows for clearence.

For demo purposes, these blocks are exactly 32mm.


## Integrating into prints

Suggested rules for integrating rails into larger designs:

Male rails are probably more durable and have little to break, and almost nothing to catch on stuff. They should be used on walls, and the tops and fronts of things.

Female rails should be used on the backs and bottoms of things. This means bottoms will need to print with support.

I'm not sure what to do about left and right sides. I would think female on the left side(Looking at it's front) and male on the right seems reasonable, but there might also be cases where dual-male or dual-female is the best option.


## Compatibles:  

### 128mm rail
A wall mount rail wide enough for 4 32mm units.

### 32mm Horizontal cable guide 
A cube-shaped hook, 32mm wide, to keep a cable going how you want it.

### 128mm decorative shelf
Has sun and moon designs on the sides.  Sticks forward a bit farther than you might like, 
as it was originally meant for a specific google alarm clock.   Has holes in the back for cables coming up from below.

### Mini 32mm pencil cup
Holds a few pencils or similar items, maybe a whiteboard marker. Also has similas cable management in case you want to use it as a housing for a DIY LED light.

### 32mm Bending Jig with storage
Handy for if you want to use 14ga wire or something instead of filament.  
Keychain sized, and has storage for 2 extra clips, plus a pair of straightening guide holes.
Requires cleaning up the holes after printing.  
  
Absolutely not needed and primarily exists to waste 7 grams of filament at the end of a spool. 
However, the bits of filament are easy to lose and drop, so having a way to carry them may be a good thing.
